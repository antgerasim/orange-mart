DON COMMENTS:
npx "path must be a string" ERROR - Fix https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/144
-> Instead of only deleting "C:\Program Files\nodejs" from system variables ("path" variable), I also added it to user variables ("path" variable), but after "%AppData%\npm".

Instead of npx @angular/cli new lemon-mart --routing -> npx -p @angular/cli ng new orange-mart --routing

A child module implements an @NgModule similar to app.module. The biggest difference is that a child module does not implement the bootstrap property, which is required for your root module, to initialize your Angular app

$ npx ng g m manager -m app --routing
READ: generate module of name "manager"
option: -m means import the module into app.module 
option: --routing means a routing module has been created and imported into ManagerModule 
$ npx ng g c home -m app --inline-template --inline-style
READ: generate component of name "home"
option: -m means import the component into app.module
option: --inline-template means no single .html file generated
option: --inline-style means no singlr.css file generated
$ npx ng g c manager/managerHome -m manager -s -t
READ: generate component of name "manager" into manager/manager-home directory
option: -m means import the component into manager.module
option: -s shorthand for --inline-style
option: -t shorthand for --inline-template
